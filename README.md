### <span style="color:#6699CC">Learning Goals:</span>

I wanted to gather experience using document-oriented databases, since I've only used relational databases thus far. MongoDB Atlas seemed like a good start, though I want to dabble with Firebase next.

Gain experience in Redux, custom middleware and mongoose. Will try ContextAPI in my next project to garner different perspectives on state handling. I've also implemented sass functions to create dynamic styling. ie: if dark background use light text and vice versa.

Another goal was to develope greater care in directory structure, although late into the project I wanted to incorporate a Pages folder for major components. Will likely try that structure in my next project (Ecommerce app).
